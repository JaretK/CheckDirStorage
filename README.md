# CheckDirStorage

A simple command line tool that lists the contents of a directory and their file size. Useful for pruning files from a file system and checking the contents of large directories. 

Future directions: Increase readability by making each file/dir line a standard width

Note to myself: This script is located in ~/scripts (part of PATH)
